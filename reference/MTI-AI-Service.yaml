    <b>Whiteboarding exercise for AI Engineer</b>

    Background:
    - A client requires a system that receives pictures as input and outputs a text that is found within the picture. 
    - The system must be on deployed on the cloud and the text being read may contain person identifying information (PII). 
    - The average load system is expected to be 10 requests a minute, with a burst rate of 2 requests a second. The average processing time is 20 seconds, but the core component does not guarantee to return correct results. The user expects the system to return result in 30 seconds. 
    - The user can also check the results generated in the last 7 days, but images processed beyond 7 days ago are purged from the system.

    Design an architecture for such a system on a cloud that would support the requirements.

    Consider the following:
    - API(REST API) - Discuss how client will follow an approach to communicate with the service along with load balancer which is the front end of the service.
    - Application Layer – Discuss how the worker thread or hosts that will take the input, send it to the core component, obtain the result and store result in the database .
    - Persistence Layer – Database

    Final part: explain the architectural choices to non-technical audience
